## Android

    No steps required

    Note: To enable android push notifications in the demo project:

    i. In the case of using Linux, give all permissions to the gradlew, using:

      ```
      cd android
      chmod +x gradlew
      ./gradlew clean
      ```

It is recommended to run `npx react-native start` command from root project directory.

Run your project from XCode (Cmd+R) for iOS, or use `npx react-native run-android` to run your project on Android.

If on Android, there is an error when running the app on the emulator or device, start the app with `npx react-native start --reset-cache`.
